### 3. Calculate Pot Odds

#### POST /api/calculate

Calculates pot odds and identifies outs with their draw types for a given poker hand.

**Primary Purpose:**  
Calculates the risk-reward ratio (pot odds) based on poker outs, allowing players to make mathematically sound decisions. Results include a single pot odds ratio and outs categorized by draw type.

---

#### Calculation Algorithm

- Your hole cards and any community cards are analyzed.
- The algorithm identifies all possible outs that improve your hand.
- Each out is categorized by the type of draw it represents (flush, straight, pair, etc.).
- Pot odds are calculated based on the probability of hitting these outs.
- The pot odds ratio is simplified to be based on 1 and rounded to the first decimal point (e.g., "5.1:1" instead of "8353:1646"). If the decimal is .0, it's rounded up to the integer (e.g., "4:1" instead of "4.0:1").
- Special case: The API returns `"NUTS!"` for `pot_odds_ratio` when the player's current best 5-card hand (using their hole cards and community cards) cannot be beaten by any other possible 5-card hand given the current board.
  - The player's hand must be complete and unbeatable (the "nuts")
  - At least one hole card must be part of the best 5-card hand
  - Board-only hands (where hole cards are not used) do not qualify
  - This applies to completed hands at any stage (flop, turn, or river)
  - Tied hands (where other players could have the same best hand) still qualify as "NUTS!"
  - Note: "Completes" refers to the player's current hand being complete and unbeatable, not about completing a draw or improving their hand

**Pot Odds Calculation:**
- Pot odds ratio formula:  
  \[
    \text{Pot Odds Ratio} = \frac{\text{Chance of losing}}{\text{Chance of winning}}
  \]
- The ratio is always simplified to be based on 1 and rounded to the first decimal point
- If the decimal is .0, it's rounded up to the integer (e.g., 4.0:1 becomes 4:1)
- If win probability is 20%:  
  80:20 = 4:1
- If win probability is 16.47%:  
  8353:1646 â‰ˆ 5.1:1

    }
  ]
}
```

2. No duplicates across hole_cards and community_cards
3. Respect array length constraints

**Error Response (422):**
```json
{
  "detail": [

      "loc": ["body", "hole_cards", 0],
      "msg": "Invalid card notation: XX. Use format like 'As', 'Kh', '7d'",
      "type": "value_error"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Data Models

### Card Notation Format

- Two-character string: Rank then Suit
- Valid ranks: `2-9`, `T`, `J`, `Q`, `K`, `A`
- Valid suits: `s` (Spades), `h` (Hearts), `d` (Diamonds), `c` (Clubs)
- Example: `"As"` (Ace of Spades)

---

## Error Handling

All errors use FastAPI's error format:
```json
